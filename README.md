## 🕹️ Game mechanics

- 🌍 **Levels representing musical genres** 
 Each level transports players to a **world visually and sonically** inspired by a musical genre, from the pulsing neons of techno music to the smoky blues of a jazz lounge. Bosses embody each genre with animations, attacks, and statistics that reflect the genre they belong to.

- 🏆**Music checkpoints** 
 At specific points in each fight (corresponding to certain percentages of the opponent's life), the game stops and offers the player a **choice of instruments**. Each instrument:
 - modifies gameplay (e.g., increases speed, reduces damage, adds area effects)
 - alters the **real-time sound track**, overlaying or replacing musical elements.

- 🎖️**Audio rewards** 
 Upon winning, players earn genre-specific **music tracks**.
  - These can be uploaded to the game's **digital audio workstation (DAW)**, where they will **compose their own songs**, apply effects and mix tracks.
 This encourages **creative composition** and introduces basic production concepts.
